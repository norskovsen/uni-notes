- *Fully synchronous:* Each process $P$ has a clock $c(P)$ and there is a known bound $\Delta_\text{CLOCK}$ on how far they drift from real time.
	- There is also a known upper bound $\Delta_\text{SEND}$ on how long it takes to send a message between any two parties
	- The model often assumes some noting of global time what is used to define what the real time is.
	- $N$ is used to denote nature and $c(N)$ to denote real time: the time of nature

- *Fully asynchronous:* The process $P$ do not even have clocks
	- The protocols cannot be specified b asking parties to do things at specific times
	- There are no know upper bound on how long it takes to send a message
	- It is assumed that if a message is sent by a correct process and that process never crashes
	- The delivery is model as follows
		- There is a value $\Delta_\text{SEND}$
		- If a message is send by a correct process that does not crash then it is delivered within that bound

- *Eventually synchronous:* A popular mixed model, where the processors have clocks.
	- Two bounds $\Delta_{CLOCK}$ and $\Delta_{SEND}$ are given
