    "- It is possible that a entity set appears more than one time in a relationship\n",

    "- A **key** for a set $E$ is a set $K$ of one or more attributes such that if given any two distinct enties they cannot have a identical value for the attributes in $K$\n",

    "    - There can be more than one key for an entity set though one key is often used as the primary key\n",
    "    - When a entity set i envovled in a isa-hierarchy we require the root to have all attributes needed for a key and that the key is found in the *\"subclasses\"*\n",
    "    - In the E/R diagram attributes belonging to a key are underlined\n",

    "    1. Zero or more of its own attributes\n",
    "    2. Key attributes that are reached by certain many-one relationships are called **supporting relationsships** for $E$ and the entity sets reached from $E$ are **supporting entity sets**\n",

    "- $E$ is a entity set if $E$ followes the following conditions then we can replace $E$ by an attribute or attributes of other entity sets\n",

    "    - The attributes of a relation is a set not a list, but to the attributes in a schema is in a order\n",
    "    - The set of schemas for the relations of a database is called a relational database schema or a database schema\n",
    "    - Example schema: `Movies(title, year, length, genre)`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- The rows of a database other than the header row are called tuples \n",
    "    - A tuple has one component for each attribute of the relation\n",
    "    - Example tuple: `(Gone With the Wind, 1939, 231, drama)`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Each row has a domain which is the type of data the row can cotain\n",

    "    1. Character strings of fixed of varying length\n",
    "        - `CHAR(n)` denotes a fixed length string of up to `n` characters and implies that short strings are padded to make `n` characters\n",
    "        - `VARCHAR(n)` also denotes a fixed length string of up to `n` characters and implies that a string-length is used\n",
    "    2. Bit strings of fixed or varying length\n",

    "        - The compiled host-language program, including these function calls, is a module.\n",
    "    3. **True Modules** a collection of stored functions are procedures, some of which are hostlanguage code and some of which are SQL statements\n",

    "## JDBC\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "- JDBC, stands for Java Database Connectivity, which allows java programs to access SQL databases \n",
    "- To use JDBC the following must be done\n",
    "    1. Include the line\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        import java.sql.*;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    to make the classes available to the java program\n",
    "    2. Load the driver for the desired database system with the statement \n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "       Class.forName(<driver name>) ; \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    To load the one for mysql type\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        Class.forName(\"com.mysql.jdbc.Driver\");\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This does that the class `DriverManager` is available \n",
    "    3. Establish a connection to the database by creating a variable of class `Connection` if by applying the method `getConnection` to `DriverManager`\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "        Connection myCon = DriverManager.getConnection(<URL>,\n",
    "            <user name>, <password>);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- To connect to mysql the form of the url is \n",
    "```\n",
    "    jdbc:mysql://<host name>/<database name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating statements\n",
    "- There are two methods that can be applied to a Connection object in order to create statements\n",
    "    1. `createStatement()` \n",
    "        - returns a `Statement` object\n",
    "        - has no associated SQL statement yet \n",
    "    2. `prepareStatement(Q)` \n",
    "        - returns a `PreparedStatement` object\n",
    "        - Where `Q` is a SQL query passed as a string argument \n",
    "        - Often used when the same query is repeated a lot of times\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- The four different \"execute\" methods are\n",
    "    1. `executeQuery(Q)` \n",
    "        - returns a `ResultSet` object which is a bag of tuples produced by the query `Q` \n",
    "        - applied to a `Statement` object \n",
    "        - takes a parameter `Q` which must be a SQL statement\n",
    "    2. `executeQuery()`\n",
    "        - returns a `ResultSet` object\n",
    "        - applied to a `PreparedStatement` object\n",
    "    3. `executeUpdate(U)`\n",
    "        - takes a nonquery statement `U` \n",
    "        - executes `U` when applied to a `Statement` object \n",
    "        - Nothing returned\n",
    "    4. `executeUpdate()` \n",
    "        - applied to a `PreparedStatement` object \n",
    "        - The SQL statement associated with the prepared statement is executed.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Cursor operations in JDBC \n",
    "- To run the cursor through a `ResultSet` object the following methods can be used \n",
    "    1. `next()` \n",
    "        - causes the cursor to move to the next tuple\n",
    "        - returns `false` if there is no next tuple\n",
    "    2. `getString(i)`, `getlnt(i)`, `getFloat(i)` and analogous methods for the other types\n",
    "        - returns the `i`th component of the tuple the cursor is currently on \n",
    "        - the method is a appropriate to the type \n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter passing\n",
    "- A question-mark in a place of the query and then bind those values to parameters\n",
    "    - This can be done in a prepared statement\n",
    "    - Can be applied using the methods `setString(i, v)` or `setInt (i, v)` to bind the value `v` to the `i`th parameter\n",
    "- E.g. \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "PreparedStatement studioStat = myCon.prepareStatement(\n",
    "\t\"INSERT INTO Studio(name, address) VALUES(?, ?)\");\n",

    "- SQL postulates the existence of authorization ID's which is essentially user names\n",
    "    - SQL has a special authorization ID called `PUBLIC` which includes any user\n",
    "    - may be granted privileges \n",
    "\n",
    "## Privileges\n",
    "- SQL defines nine types of privileges: \n",
    "    - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, \n",
    "        - Apply to a relation which may be either a base table or view\n",
    "        - They give the holder of the privilege the right to \n",
    "            - query the relation\n",
    "            - insert into the relation\n",
    "            - delete from the relation\n",
    "            - update tuples of the relation\n",
    "            - `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` may also have an associated list of attributes \n",
    "    - `REFERENCES`\n",
    "        - The right to refer to that relation in an integrity constraint\n",
    "        - The constraint may be in any form\n",
    "        - May have an attach list of attributes \n",

    "    - `TRIGGER`\n",
    "        - The right to define triggers on that relation\n",
    "    - `EXECUTE`\n",

    "- The owner of something has all privileges associated with that thing\n",
    "- There are three points in which an ownership is establish in mysql\n",
    "    1. When a schema is created, it and other schema elements in it are owned by the user who created it \n",
    "    2. When a session is initiated with a CONNECT statement, there is an opportunity to indicate the user with an AUTHORIZATION clause. \n",
    "    3. When a module is created there is an option to give it an owner by using an AUTHORIZATION clause. For instance, a clause `AUTHORIZATION picard` in a module creation statement would make the user picard the owner of that module.\n",
    "        - If no owner is specified the module becomes publicly available \n",
    "\n",
    "## Privilege-Checking \n",
    "- Any SQL operation has two parties \n",
    "    1. The database element upon which the operation is performed \n",
    "    2. The agent that causes that operation\n",
    "- The privileges available to the agent derive from a particular authorization ID called the **current authorization ID**\n",
    "- The current authorization id is either\n",
    "    1. The module authorization id if that module the agent i executing has an authorization id \n",
    "    2. The session authorization id \n",
    "\n",
    "## Granting Privileges\n",
    "- SQL provides the `GRANT` statement to allow one user to give privileges to another\n",
    "    - A grant statement has the form:\n",
    "```mysql\n",
    "    GRANT <privilege list> ON <database element> TO <user list>\n",
    "```\n",
    "    possible followed by `WITH GRANT OPTION` if you want the user to be able to grant privileges to other users\n",
    "    - The keyword `ALL PRIVILEGES` may be used to grant all privileges to a particular database element\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grant diagrams\n",
    "- Grants can be represented by a **grant diagram**\n",
    "- The nodes in a grant diagram correspond to a user and a privilege\n",
    "    - The privilege to do something with a grant privilege and without one are two different privileges \n",
    "    - \\*\\* on a node indicates that the privilege derives from the owner ship of that relation \n",
    "    - \\* is used to show that the privilege includes a grant option \n",
    "- If user $U$ grants privilege $P$ to user $V$, and this grant was based on the fact that $U$ holds privilege $Q$, then we draw an arc from the node for $U$/$Q$ to the node for $V$/$P$.\n",

    "## Revoking Privileges\n",
    "- A granted privilege can be revoked at any time\n",
    "- The revoking of privileges may be required to cascade in a sense where all the privileges granted by that user is revoked\n",
    "- The simple form of a revoke statement is\n",
    "```mysql\n",
    "    REVOKE <privilege list> ON <database element> FROM <user list>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The statement ends with one of the following\n",
    "    1. `CASCADE` \n",
    "        - If user U has revoked privilege P from user V , based on privilege Q belonging to U, then we delete the arc in the grant diagram from U/Q to V/P.\n",
    "        - Any node not accessible from the ownership node is also revoked \n",
    "    2. `RESTRICT` \n",
    "        - In this case, the revoke statement cannot be executed if the cascading rule described in the previous item would result in the revoking of any privileges due to the revoked privileges having been passed on to others.\n",
    "- `REVOKE` can be replaced by `REVOKE GRANT OPTION FOR` in which the core privileges are preserved but the grant option is removed\n",
