    "\n",
    "## Software Development Methods\n",
    "- A software development processes must have defined tecniquest to deal with activities or steps in developent, the steps often includes\n",
    "    - **Requirements**. How do you collect the users´and customers´expectation to the software?\n",
    "    - **Design** How do you structure and partion the software and how do you communicate it\n",
    "    - **Implementation** How do developers program the software so that it fulfills the requirements and adheres to the design?\n",
    "    - **Deployment** How do you ensure that the software system executes in the right environment\n",
    "    - **Maintenance** How can we ensure that the soft ware is correct and enhance the defects discorvered. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **waterfall method** is the method where you completly finished the requirement before starting on the next one (is cheap but hard to use)\n",

    "## Agile Methods\n",
    "- [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)\n",
    "- Examples of agile methods\n",
    "    - Extreme Programming (XP)\n",
    "    - Scrum\n",
    "    - Crystal Clear\n",
    "- Agile methods value to move towards the defined goal with speed while maintaining the ability to change to a better route without great cost\n",
    "- Agile methods put a lot of emphasis on software development as a team effort\n",
    "- Agile methods focuses on making the high quality code rather than and less on writing docmentation \n",
    "    - Testing is central when trying to keep the code hight quality\n",
    "    - Refactoring is central to improve the quality of the code\n",
    "- Agile methods focuses a lot on customer collaboration\n",
    "    - It is important to have customers use the product before it is finished, because it makes it easier to corect errors\n",
    "    - Small releases can be used\n",
    "- It is important to revisit the plan during development\n",
    "    - When working on a product you learn many new things\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extreme Programming (XP)\n",
    "- Extreme programming was one of the first agile methods\n",
    "- It is important to have a good balance on the four parameters cost, time, scope and quality\n",
    "    - cost, time and scope is often the fixed values from the company\n",
    "    - It is better to have cost, time and quality as fixed value, because two great implemented features is better than tree poorly implemented features\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- XP has four central values\n",
    "    - **Communication** Good communication is a primary cure for mistakes. XP value interaction between everyone\n",
    "    - **Simplicity** In XP you focus on the features to put into the next small release.\n",
    "    - **Feedback** XP focus on feedback in the minutes and hours time scale\n",
    "    - **Courage** It is important to have the courage to throw away bad designed and/or low quality code \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- A central technique in XP is pair programming\n",
    "    - One person sits at the computer and codes\n",
    "    - The other person is think strategically and evaluates the design, the code etc. \n",
    "    - Pairs are often dynamic\n",
    "    - Collective ownership is used so everyone can change the code, if they think they can make it better\n",
    "    - It focuses on quality because no code is never written without being read through\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated testing is vital in XP\n",
    "    - It is carried out by computers\n",
    "    - Computers does not make mistakes \n",
    "    - The system gives feedback on its health and quality\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- XP is a highly iterative development process\n",
    "    - Work is organized in small iterations each with a well defined focus\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- XP uses stories to describe the behavior of the system"

    "- A defect (or bug) is the algorithmic cause of failure \n",

    "    - Test cases are defined by the unit under test (some part of the system)\n",
    "- A test suite is a set of test cases \n",
    "    - Is often represented by a **test case table**\n",
    "- A failed test can be referred to as a broken test\n",
    "- Manual testing where suites of test cases are executed a verified manually by humans\n",
    "- Regression testing is the repeated execution of test suites to ensure they still pass and the system does not fail after a modification\n",
    "- Automated testing is a processes where the test suites are executed and verified by computer programs\n",

    "    - **One Steps Test:** Pick a test that will teach you something and that you can implement\n",
    "    - **Fake It (´Til You Make It):** What is your first implementation once you have a broken test? Return a constant and then gradually transform it \n",
    "    - **Triangulation:** Abstract only when you have two or more examples\n",
    "    - **Isolated Test:** The running of tests should not affect one another\n",
    "    - **Evident Data:** Make the expected and actual results relationship apparent.\n",
    "    - **Representative Data:** Select a small set of data where each element represents a conceptual aspect or a special computational processing\n",
    "    - **Assert First:** Write asserts first\n",
    "    - **Obvious Implementation:** Just implement simple operations\n",
    "    - **Evident Tests:** To avoid writing defective tests, we keep the testing code evident, readable and as simple as possible\n",
