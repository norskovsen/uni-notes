    "## Theories and models\n",
    "- Often abstract and application-independent\n",
    "- We can distinguish between predictive vs. explanatory and descriptive theories\n",
    "- Predictive: e.g., Keystroke-Level Model, Fitts' Law\n",
    "- Explanatory and descriptive\n",
    "- Mental and conceptual model\n",
    "    - The designer has an conceptual model of how the interface should work\n",
    "    - System image is the representation of your own model in your\n",
    "    - The user has the mental model which is the users own model of how the application work\n",

    "    - Functiontality is visible for the person using the interface\n",
    "- **Affordances**\n",
    "    - Inspired by physical objects\n",
    "    - Gives a clue about an action possiblity\n",
    "    - E.g. people perceive 3D buttons as affording pushing\n",
    "    - Tell you something you can do, not what you can do\n",
    "    - Flat design makes interfaces harder to use\n",
    "- **Feedback**\n",
    "    - Providing information to user to tell what happenend\n",
    "    - Reassures the user that something happend\n",
    "    - Can be provided as audio\n",
    "- **Natural mapping**\n",
    "    - There should be a natural mapping between controls and their effect\n",
    "    - The command you give should result in an expected reaction\n",
    "- **Constraint**\n",
    "    - Constraint the possible action\n",
    "    - Manage complexity or avoid mistakes\n",
    "    - Physical constraints: e.g. an ethernet cable does not fit in a usb port\n",

    "    - Use the same ways \n",

    "    - The opposite of feedback\n",
    "    - Helps the user to know what to expect before the action is performed\n",

    "1. Consistency\n",
    "    - Consistent sequence of actions\n",
    "    - Consistent across platforms or integrate with other platforms in that platform\n",
    "2. Universal usability\n",
    "    - recognize the need of diverse users\n",
    "        - Novices and expert \n",
    "        - Age\n",
    "    - Shortcuts for advanced users\n",
    "3. Informative feedback\n",
    "    - For every user action, there should be a feedback\n",
    "    - especially for uncommon action\n",
    "4. Design dialogs to yield closure\n",
    "    - Sequences of actions should be organized into groups with a beginning, middle and end \n",
    "    - Informative feedback at the completion of a sequence of actions\n",
    "5. Prevent Error\n",
    "    - Users cannot make serious errors\n",
    "    - Simple constructive messages\n",
    "    - Specific instructions for recovery\n",
    "    - Leave the interface state unchanged \n",
    "6. Permit easy reversal of action\n",
    "    - Action should be reversible\n",
    "    - Relieves anxiety \n",
    "    - Encourage exploration\n",
    "    - You can undo a group or one action\n",
    "7. Keep users in control\n",
    "    - They don't want surprise\n",
    "    - Allow the user to control the system or they might not use it \n",
    "8. Reduce short-term memory load\n",
    "    - Humans can hold a limit amount of information in short term memory\n",
    "    - Avoid interface where users must remember information from one display to another\n",
